## Task 1: Super Mario
![alt text](https://github.com/ulrichwohak/coding1_assignment1/blob/main/Super-Mario-Bros-scene-where-Mario-need-to-jump-over-a-gap-from-the-first-pyramid-to-the.ppm.png)


In this task you will have to use loops, `if` conditions and the `print` function to build an obstacle similar to the ones you would find in Super Mario. To do this, build a pyramid using hashes (`#`) as building blocks for your pyramid with 5 levels. The output should look like this:

`    #`  
`   ##`  
`  ###`  
` ####`  
`#####`  

## Task 2: (Super) Super Mario
Write a function that takes as input an argument `levels` and returns a pyramid like in Task 1 with the number of levels equal to `levels` (i.e. the user of you function can decide the number of levels of the pyramid the function will produce). Note that for this function, you do not necessarily need a `return` statement.  

## Task 3: Pandas practice
Follow the homework instructions here: https://github.com/ulrichwohak/da-coding-python/tree/main/lecture04-pandas-basics  
Write a program that completes the task specified in the link above.
