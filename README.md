In this task you will have to use loops, `if` conditions and the `print` function to build an obstacle similar to the ones you would find in Super Mario. To do this, build a pyramid using hashes (`#`) as building blocks for your pyramid with 5 levels. The output should look like this:

`    #`  
`   ##`  
`  ###`  
` ####`  
`#####`
